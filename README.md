# filecastalogue
Holds versions of sets of files over a common per-file normalized blob storage.

### TODO
* Needs OsString support for paths all around, including the
    JSON files, or some other (JSON/network compatible) way of
    encoding non-unicode filenames in order to support the full
    range of possible POSIX paths.
